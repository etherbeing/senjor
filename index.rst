Senjor
====================

Senjor is a django framework that aims to enables with few to no configuration at all a standard but useful GraphQL over Socket.IO API, it also includes by default the integration to your preferred OAuth server and other authentication and authorization mechanisms servers, finally but not least perhaps the more powerfull capability of this framework is the ability to turn your already created templates into ReactJS components and connect to your server through our GraphQL interface over socket.io, this capability which is planned to be implemented in version 2.0.x, enables you to extend your django app using ReactJS like if you were programming for the frontend, either if you're a frontend developer or a backend developer we got you covered.
